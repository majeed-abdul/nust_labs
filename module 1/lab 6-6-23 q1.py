# And now the end is here
# And so I face that final curtain
# My friend I'll make it clear
# I'll state my case, of which I'm certain
# I've lived a life that's full
# I traveled each and every highway
# And more, much more
# I did it, I did it my way

# Regrets, I've had a few
# But then again too few to mention
# I did what I had to do
# I saw it through without exemption
# I planned each charted course
# Each careful step along the byway
# And more, much, much more
# I did it, I did it my way

# Yes, there were times I'm sure you knew
# When I bit off more than I could chew
# But through it all, when there was doubt
# I ate it up and spit it out
# I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way

# For what is a man, what has he got?
# If not himself then he has naught
# Not to say the things that he truly feels
# And not the words of someone who kneels
# Let the record shows I took all the blows and did it my way
